                <h2> I'm a bit of a Computer Enthusiast </h2>
                <h4> From building them as a hobby and then playing video games on them!</h4>
                <p> Starting back since I was very young I was always into computers and the oldest memory I have is playing some online mario game on an old Windows XP machine. Fast forward quite a bit of years and it's become of my greatest passions. I love tinkering with devices and buying all the parts indivudally in order to build your own computer is too rewarding for me. I'm also a huge gamer that loves when games look graphically amazing, hence why I build a new computer every 3-4 years to keep up with modern technology. </p>
                
                <h4> A deeper look into the madness that I love</h4>
                <p> Going deeper into this hobby let me explain the process for building a computer. First you must choose the parts: there's a GPU, CPU, PSU, Motherboard, RAM, CPU Cooler, Storage (HDD/SSD), and finally the computer case itself. Since I like to call myself an enthusiast, I went for a beefy build. In the middle picture to my left, I went for an i7 13700k processor, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, an RTX 3080ti graphics card as my main powerhouse components. To rewind a bit, it's usually a good idea to test the parts beforehand through a Frankenstein setup without the PC case which is what I did in the first image. Now for the results? This PC can run any high-end game at a solid 60 Frames per second at most maxed-out graphics options. In the last image I'm playing a very demanding game called Witcher 3 and it ran it with no problems whatsoever. Graphics in gaming has taken such a leap in the past 20 years that it brings me great joy seeing insane realistic graphics for a videogame, with some games it can even get to the point of photo-realism which is insane to think about. Food for thought though!</p>
